    "Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current President of the United States, in office since January 20, 2017. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality. Trump was born in Queens, New York City, and earned an economics degree from the Wharton School. For 45 years, he managed The Trump Organization, the real estate development firm founded by his paternal grandmother. His career focused on building or renovating office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He started several side ventures and branded various products with his name. He produced and hosted The Apprentice television show for 12 years. As of 2017, he was the 544th richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion. Trump had long expressed interest in politics; he eventually entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Scholars and commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His campaign received extensive media coverage. Many of his public statements were controversial or false. Trump won the general election on November 8, 2016, in a surprise victory against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. During the Trump presidency, the United States started a process to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Trump attempted to impose a travel ban from several Muslim-majority states, but several federal courts issued injunctions preventing implementation of the ban. U.S. war efforts expanded in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen. Both his inauguration and certain policies, such as the travel ban, produced large protests throughout the United States. During the election, Russia interfered to support his campaign, sparking an FBI investigation. In May 2017 Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to investigate issues involving Russia and the Trump campaign.",

    "Going through airport security is a universally painful experience. And despite being slow and invasive, the TSA doesn’t have a great record at catching threats. With the help of the Kaggle data science community, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is hosting an online competition to build machine learning-powered tools that can augment agents, ideally making the entire system simultaneously more accurate and efficient. Kaggle, acquired by Google earlier this year, regularly hosts online competitions where data scientists compete for money by developing novel approaches to complex machine learning problems. Today’s competition to improve threat recognition algorithms will be Kaggle’s third launch this year featuring more than a million dollars in prize money. With a top prize of $500,000 and a total of $1.5 million at stake, competitors will have to accurately predict the location of threat objects on the body. The TSA is making its data set of images available to competitors so they can train on images of people carrying weapons. Importantly, these will be staged images created by the TSA rather than real-world examples — a necessary move to ensure privacy. “The outcome of the competition will be a good indicator for how well we can expect such systems to work,” Reza Zadeh, founder and CEO of computer vision startup Matroid told me. “At the very least, we should have such a system augmenting current security guards to ensure they don’t miss dangerous items.”Of course, the problem the TSA faces isn’t just a machine learning issue. Expensive physical machines are complicated to upgrade, and none feature the kinds of sophisticated GPUs found in modern data centers. Thankfully, Google, Facebook and others are heavily investing in lighter versions of machine learning frameworks, optimized to run locally, at the edge (without internet) This means that it’s possible that some submissions to this competition could wind up in use on actual scanning machines — it’s just a matter of training beforehand and optimizing for the constrained conditions. The DHS has promised to work closely with the winners to explore potential real-world applications. “This is a really hard problem, machines do not have crazy GPUs,” Anthony Goldbloom, Kaggle’s creator, told me in an interview. “But one thing that gets lost is that doing inference doesn’t necessarily need such heavy compute.” Another concern that Kaggle and the TSA had to account for was the risk of bias influencing the automated threat detection process — a potential nightmare for travelers that could be inappropriately segregated based on arbitrary factors. To mitigate this, the TSA put special effort into creating the data set of images that will ultimately be used to train the detectors. “The TSA did a nice job in setting this up,” Goldbloom emphasized. “They recruited volunteers but made sure that they had a decent amount of diversity so models don’t fail on a certain type of person.” Google plans to make GCP available to competitors in the near future. And though Google owns Kaggle, it is thankfully not forcing people to use TensorFlow, its own open-source framework. You can check out additional details here; the competition will draw to a close in December.",
    "For years, the Honda Clarity has been one thing: a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered sedan available for lease to a vetted group of early adopters in California. Now in its third generation, the Honda Clarity fuel-cell car is still basically that. But it’s getting a couple of friends. This year, the Honda Clarity adds two new versions: an all-electric car and a plug-in hybrid. Granted, the fuel cell Clarity is technically an electric car, but the electric version charges at any outlet rather than being fueled at a so-far rare hydrogen fueling station. The three were shown together for the first time in the United States since their unveiling at the New York Auto Show at the Drive Revolution event in Portland, Oregon. Journalists had the chance to drive them back to back to evaluate their similarities and differences over short urban routes — and to compare them to their energy-efficient competitors. There are, of course, similarities in the design; these are all Clarity models. There are subtle differences in the grilles, and they have badging specific to their drivetrain type, but otherwise they are identical large four-door sedans. This one-car-many-powertrains strategy is one other manufacturers are using, as well, especially when it comes to advanced drivetrain technologies. Hyundai, for example, has the Ioniq series, with hybrid, PHEV and EV versions. As Natalie Kumaratne, a Clarity specialist for Honda, pointed out, this makes it easier for manufacturers to respond to changes in consumers’ buying habits. Right now, PHEVs are gaining in popularity, and the Clarity PHEV will be available in all 50 states. The Clarity fuel cell is only available in California because that’s where the infrastructure exists to make these cars practical. The Clarity EV is somewhere in the middle of that mix. When hydrogen stations become more widespread, or when EV demand reaches a tipping point, the mix can change at the factory in Japan more easily than if these were separate models. Driving dynamics for the three cars are very similar, but ranges are wildly different. The EV has a range of about 90 miles per charge; the PHEV drives 42 miles on electric power alone and 330 miles with the gasoline engine; and the fuel cell can travel 366 miles, the highest range of any zero-emissions vehicle in the country. Kumaratne noted that Honda is all in on fuel cell technology. The company sees it as a major part of its electrification process, and it has set a goal of selling 75,000 total Clarity vehicles in the United States in the next four years. That’s part of its larger goal of having 60 percent or more of its sales worldwide be electric vehicles by 2030.",
    "Periscope’s new Super Hearts tipping feature that launched yesterday quickly sparked a backlash from the creators it was designed to help earn money. Broadcasters discovered that if they deleted the replay of one of their live videos before cashing out their tips at the end of the month, they’d lose any tips received during the stream. That meant if a video was overly personal or sensitive, unflattering or a creator otherwise didn’t want the replay on the internet, they’d be forced to forfeit money they’d earned. Twitter already takes a 30 percent cut of tips after the app store’s tax and payment processing fees are removed. TechCrunch heard about the issue this morning and asked Twitter for an explanation of why it would need to delete people’s tips if they deleted their replays. Initially a spokesperson merely replied that broadcasters can delete replays after they cash out their tips at the end of the month, and pointed to the broadcaster guidelines. But after the outrage from broadcasters snowballed, Periscope tweeted that it’s working on a way for broadcasters to hide replays from the public without technically deleting them. Then Periscope followed up with me, noting that the rule against deletion was designed “to ensure all content that’s has been monetized complies with our community guidelines.” It presumably wanted to avoid paying people for tips they earned through nudity or scams, but went too far. The situation proves how tricky it is to expand from an advertising business model with professional clients to sharing revenue with finicky independent content creators. One broadcaster told TechCrunch that Super Hearts tipping is “a great first step, but realistically this is going to provide pocket change for broadcasters. This isn’t going to be a monetization feature that will allow people to make big bucks, so I think they have to manage expectations with that.”",
    "Latency is a critical determinant of the quality of experience for many Internet applications. Google and Bing report that a few hundred milliseconds of additional latency in delivering search results causes significant reduction in search volume, and hence, revenue. In online gaming, tens of milliseconds make a huge difference, thus driving gaming companies to build specialised networks targeted at reducing latency. Present efforts at reducing latency, nevertheless, fall far short of the lower bound dictated by the speed of light in vacuum [1]. What if the Internet worked at the speed of light? Ignoring the technical challenges and cost of designing for that goal for the moment, let us briefly think about its implications. A speed-of-light Internet would not only dramatically enhance web browsing and gaming as well as various forms of “tele-immersion”, but it could also potentially open the door for new, creative applications to emerge. Thus, we set out to understand and quantify the gap between the typical latencies we observe today and what is theoretically achievable. Our largest set of measurements was performed between popular web servers and PlanetLab nodes, a set of generally well-connected machines in academic and research institutions across the world [2]. We evaluated our measured latencies against the lower bound of c-latency; that is, the time needed to traverse the geodesic distance between the two endpoints at the speed of light in vacuum. Our measurements reveal that the Internet is much, much slower than it could be: fetching just the HTML of the landing pages of popular websites is (in the median) ~37 times worse than c-latency. Note that this is typically tens of kilobytes of data, thus making bandwidth constraints largely irrelevant in this context.",
    "Microsoft now has a variety of Surface devices that are designed to replace your laptop. There’s the Surface Book with a removable display, the Surface Pro with a kickstand, and now the new Surface Laptop that is the most traditional laptop Microsoft has ever made. I’ve been using all three extensively recently and have been able to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each. If you’re thinking about buying one of Microsoft’s Surface devices, here’s what you need to know. Surface Book Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge I reviewed the original Surface Book nearly two years ago, and while I’ve been using it as my day-to-day laptop, it’s far from perfect. Microsoft created the Book with a detachable display, and it’s something I rarely ever use. You can push a button and the display will release and transform into a large tablet. I’ve used this for taking down notes or showing friends YouTube videos, but unless you’re an illustrator, it’s not a feature you’re likely to use regularly. Using the Surface Book as a tablet isn’t ideal, either. Battery life when detached from the base is only around three hours, and it doesn’t have a kickstand to prop it up on a desk or table. Windows 10 still lacks tablet apps, so its best for basic tasks like watching videos or browsing the web. If that’s all you want to do, then it’s fine for that, but for anything more you’ll want a dedicated tablet like the iPad. If you stick to using the Surface Book as a laptop, you’ll have a better experience. While the display is a little wobbly and top heavy at times, the base for the keyboard is sturdy and great for writing long emails or typing out dissertations. I rarely use the touchscreen, but I do occasionally reach up and swipe away notifications, scroll a webpage, or pinch-to-zoom on a picture. A touchscreen on a laptop isn’t essential, but you’ll notice a lack of one if you get used to something like the Surface Book. The overall dimensions of the Surface Book make it heavier and chunkier than most 13-inch laptops, so consider that if you’re looking for a lighter laptop. The bonus of this heft is the battery packed into the base and the option to get a model with an additional GPU inside. The GPU-equipped Surface Books make a big difference for if you’re using them with external monitors and apps like Photoshop, and I’ve found the battery life on the Surface Book is solid at around seven hours for mixed usage.",
    "It's kind of the entire point of a trailer, if you think about it — a TV show or movie wants to get you hyped for what you're about to see, but the producers don't actually want to give away any major plot points before you watch the finished product.So every trailer features misdirects and visual trickery to make you believe you're seeing one thing, when the end result will wind up showing you something else. It's a marketing art form, and it's one that has been perfected by Game of Thrones, which is unabashedly proud of all the wicked ways in which it misleads us.Lest we forget, this is the show that made a point of convincing us (at least if we hadn't read the books) that Sean Bean was going to be the star of the show throughout its run, thanks to his prominence in all the promotional materials. Take a look back at how the first trailer portrayed Ned: Typical hero's journey stuff — which was what made his death in the ninth episode (not even the finale!) so shocking, effective, and groundbreaking.But Game of Thrones exists to subvert expectations of the fantasy genre — that was George R. R. Martin's MO when he started writing the novels — so it should be no surprise that the show is as talented in the art of trickery as Littlefinger. HBO has now released two trailers for Season 7, and while we're desperately scouring them for clues about what might be in store in the next seven episodes, we also figured we'd take a look back at the Season 6 trailers, to see whether the things that were played up in the promos actually played out the way we assumed.
